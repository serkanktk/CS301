# CS301 - Longest Path Problem: Group #151 Report Summary

In our project, we tackled the Longest Path problem from Graph Theory, aiming to identify the longest simple path in undirected graphs. We explored two distinct algorithms: a Brute Force approach, exhaustive in nature, and a Heuristic method, leveraging a modified Depth-First Search. Our evaluations involved algorithmic analysis, sample generation, and rigorous testing. Performance results demonstrated that while the Brute Force approach is exhaustive, it's computationally expensive. The Heuristic method offers a quicker yet occasionally suboptimal solution, optimal for small to medium-sized graphs. The group's collaborative efforts included contributions from Özge Karasu and Serkan Kütük. For more details, check out the report in the repository.
